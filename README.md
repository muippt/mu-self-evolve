### 💡 Usage Examples

🧠 **Daily Experience Sedimentation** — Automatically extract corrections, errors, and positive signals from today's conversations and log them into structured files.

🔍 **VFM Verification** — Before promoting any rule to permanent memory, run deterministic verification scripts that check recurrence count, cross-task scope, and resolution rate.

🪶 **Score-Based Eviction** — Memory entries decay over time with a 30-day half-life formula; low-value entries are archived automatically while high-recurrence ones are exempt.

🏷️ **WHERE×WHY Pathology Archiving** — Every error is tagged with WHERE (error stage) and WHY (root cause type), enabling structured pattern analysis instead of vague narratives.

🧪 **Bias Audit** — Inject synthetic test entries with known properties to verify the eviction mechanism catches them correctly — like a fire drill for your memory system.

🛠️ **Active Skill Synthesis** — When ≥3 entries in the same domain cluster together, automatically generate a Skill draft (SKILL.md skeleton + script framework) for the human to review.

⏰ **Scheduled Automation** — Set up daily cron jobs that run the full 6-step evolution workflow, with an extended weekly reflection every Friday.

📊 **Cross-Environment Support** — Auto-detects OpenClaw, Claude Code, or other LLM agent environments, adapting paths and scheduling automatically.

### ✨ Core Highlights

#### 🔍 Don't Trust, Verify — The AI Can't Promote Itself

AI agents are great at spotting patterns, but terrible at judging whether those patterns are worth remembering permanently. An agent might say "I've learned this rule is important!" — but how do you know it's not hallucinating confidence?

mu-self-evolve separates **proposing** from **verifying**. The agent proposes a rule, then a Python script checks actual data: how many times has this error recurred? Across how many different tasks? Has the proposed solution actually been confirmed to work? Only when the data backs it up does the rule get promoted to permanent memory.

Think of it like a student who claims they've mastered a topic — you don't just take their word for it, you give them a test with real questions.

| Step | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| Propose | Agent | "I noticed this pattern keeps happening" |
| Verify | Script | Counts recurrence, cross-task scope, resolution rate → confidence score 0–100 |
| Promote | Gate | Confidence ≥70 + Recurrence ≥2 → write to permanent memory |

#### 🪶 Memories Fade Naturally — Like a Human Brain

Most memory systems either keep everything forever (until you manually delete) or truncate by line count (delete the oldest entries when the file gets too long). Both are bad: forever-keeping means noise drowns signal; line-count truncation might delete a crucial rule just because it's old.

mu-self-evolve uses a **time-decay formula** — each memory's importance score naturally decreases over time, just like how you forget the details of a book you read months ago, but vividly remember lessons that keep coming up in conversations.

Memories that get referenced regularly get their freshness reset. Memories that nobody touches for 30 days lose half their score. But memories that have proven useful across multiple tasks are permanently exempt — they've earned their place.

```
effective_score = VFM × 0.5^(days_since_last_seen / 30)
```

#### 🏷️ Every Mistake Gets a Diagnosis, Not Just a Description

When something goes wrong, most systems log "Error: something failed." That's about as useful as a doctor writing "Patient is sick" — you know something happened, but you can't spot patterns.

mu-self-evolve tags every error with two labels: **WHERE** (which stage did it happen at?) and **WHY** (what was the root cause?). This turns a pile of vague error logs into a structured matrix where you can instantly see patterns like "huh, 80% of our errors are in the MCP call stage, and the root cause is always token expiration."

**WHERE** (where did it break): `skill_load` · `mcp_call` · `file_write` · `api_call` · `browser_op` · `memory_op` · `agent_dispatch` · `prompt_parse` · `auth` · `other`

**WHY** (why did it break): `param_missing` · `token_expired` · `timing_race` · `perm_denied` · `knowledge_gap` · `format_mismatch` · `timeout` · `logic_error` · `config_drift` · `user_correction` · `other`

Both sets are customizable — add your own tags as your agent encounters new environments.

#### 🧪 The Garbage Collector Tests Itself

Here's a scary thought: what if the memory-cleaning mechanism itself is broken, silently deleting valuable memories while everything looks fine on the surface? You'd never know — the system reports "archived 5 entries" and you trust it, not realizing 3 of those should have been kept.

mu-self-evolve defends against this using **defect injection testing** — **injecting fake test entries with known properties** into the system — entries that are designed to be kept, archived, or exempted. After running the eviction logic, it checks whether each fake entry was handled correctly. Any mismatch means the eviction logic has a bug.

Think of it like a quality inspector who tests the quality inspector — if the checking mechanism itself is broken, everything looks fine when it's not.

### 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/muippt/mu-self-evolve.git

# 2. Initialize (auto-detects environment)
cd mu-self-evolve
python3 scripts/env_detect.py --init

# 3. Schedule daily evolution
openclaw cron add --name "🧬 Daily Evolution" --cron "30 19 * * *" --message "Run mu-self-evolve daily workflow"
```

That's it. The agent will start sedimenting experiences daily and reflecting weekly.
